-->open source container orchestration platform developed by google
-->designed to automate deployment scaling and management of containerized applications across a cluster of nodes
-->provides a consistent and reliable way to manage applications,regardless of whether they are running on-premises,in cloud or in hybrid environments
=================================
Microservices:
-->software architecture pattern that software applictaions as a collection of small,independtly deployable services
-->each microservice is designed to perform a specific function or business capability and communicates with other services over well-defined api's or protocols
======================================

Architecture of kuberenetes:
-->master node/control plane:if we set up kuberenetes on cloud, master node is taken care by the cloud-provider(eks,aks,gke)
   components-
       -API server-API server is the component of kuberenetes control plane that exposes the kuberenetes API.API server is the frontend for the kuberentes control plane
       -controller manager-that runs the controller processes
       -scheduler-control plane component that watches for the newly created pods with no assigned nodes and selects a node for them to run on
       -etcd-consistent and highly avaliable key value store used as kubernetes backing store for all cluster data
-->worker node:
   components
        -kubelet-an agent that runs on each node in a cluster.it makes sure that containers are running in a pod
                 the kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanism and ensures that  the containers describe in those PodSpecs are running and healthy
                 doesnot manage containers which are not created by kuberenets
        -kube-proxy-it is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster ,implementing part of kubernetes concept
                 maintains network rules on nodes
                 these network rules allow network communication to your pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster
